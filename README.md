# OpenStack - Customized Scheduler for efficient VNF Placement on SDN 

In a multinode OpenStack setup, the VNF placement process involves gathering user-provided VM specifications, such as vCPU and RAM, based on the specified flavor name. Utilizing a dynamic dataset, a data collection script runs to capture CPU, memory, bandwidth, RTT, latency, and throughput from each host over the past 500 seconds (customizable). A filter host script then excludes hosts unable to meet the required space for VM launch. Eligible hosts' data is stored in respective .csv files and processed through a model script, employing logistic regression for classification and LSTM for prediction. Host selection is based on the predicted probability of the host for the next 50 tuples, categorized as underutilized or overutilized. Finally, user-input for VM specifications like security group, image, and server name is taken, and the VM is launched on the chosen host.
